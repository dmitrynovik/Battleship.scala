HOW TO RUN CODE
- Required: Scala 2.10
- The main file (API implementation): see Game.scala
- Unit tests: GameTest.scala (Required: Junit-4.10, Scalatest 2.10-1.9.1)
- Produced and tested in ItelliJ IDEA

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Mutable collections  are used in the game for better performance (for instance, squares map is updated too often)
It is technically possible rewriting code using immutable data structures only: it will execute slower, although for this particular game this is not critical.
